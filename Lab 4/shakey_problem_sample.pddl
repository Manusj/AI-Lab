;; This is a problem for shakey domain
;; We are going to vary 2 parameters. The number of objects to be moves and the numbers of rooms
;; we are going to put all objects in the first room and shakey in the same room.
;; the job is to move all objects from the first to last where all rooms are after each other.

;; here are the parameters
;; objects to move (5, 7, 10)
;; rooms in the model (3, 5, 10)
